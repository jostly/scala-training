# Exercises 4: Great success!

Our hard work has paid off. Another client wants to purchase our loyalty tracking software.

However, they have a different discount structure in mind:
* After €75 of purchases, the discount is 5%
* After €200 of purchases, the discount is 15% (This requirement is optional, implement it if you have time!)

Since we do not want to fork our code base, we must support both discount structures in our releases.
Which structure to use should be configurable.

An object-oriented solution:
```scala
trait Calculator {
  def amountToPay(accumulatedValue: BigDecimal, purchaseAmount: BigDecimal): BigDecimal
}

class OldClientCalculator extends Calculator {
  ...
}

class NewClientCalculator extends Calculator {
  ...
}
```

A functional solution:
```scala
type Calculator = (BigDecimal, BigDecimal) => BigDecimal

val oldClientCalculator: Calculator = (accum, amount) => ???
val newClientCalculator: Calculator = (accum, amount) => ???
```
