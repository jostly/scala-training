# Exercise 2: Fault tolerance

## Scenario

Two problems have come to light when users have been trying the discount calculator:

* Unhelpful error messages when user enters a non-number as input
* No guard against negative numbers

To rectify this, two additional requirements are added:

1. If the input from the user can not be parsed as a decimal number, 
    print `Please input a decimal number` and abort calculation
2. If either the accumulated purchase value or the current purchase amount is negative, 
    print `Amount must be 0 or greater` and abort calculation
    
## Examples    
    
How to catch exceptions in Scala, the imperative way:

```scala
def someFunction(): Int = ???

try {
  val v = someFunction()
  println(s"Got return value: $v")
} catch {
  case t: Throwable =>
    println(s"Something went wrong: $t")
}
```

or the functional way:

```scala
import scala.util.{Failure, Success, Try}

def someFunction(): Int = ???

Try(someFunction()) match {
  case Success(v) => println(s"Got return value: $v")
  case Failure(t) => println(s"Something went wrong: $t")
}
```

## Code skeleton

Keep working in the `se.citerus.practicalscala.basic` package. Make sure you add
tests for handling the error cases.
