# Exercise 8: Back to the Future, part 3

Implement a method on the Consumer to return all the *active* accounts on the storage, with a signature like this:

```scala
def activeAccounts(today: LocalDate): Future[Set[Account]] = ???
```

For this purpose, an active account is one where the date of first purchase is less than a year before today.

Hint:
```scala
val today = LocalDate.now()
val oneYearAgo = today.minusYears(1)
if (dateOfFirstPurchase.isAfter(oneYearAgo)) {
    // Account is active...
}
```
