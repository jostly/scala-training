# Exercise 4: Retaining log of purchases

In order to be able to verify that membership status is correct, the system must retain all
changes to a member account.
 
The member account should satisfy the following API:
 
```scala
// Return the amount a customer paid for the last purchase, or 0 if no purchases are recorded
def lastPaidAmount: BigDecimal

// Return the list of all purchases made for a member account, in date order with the latest
// purchase first
def purchases: List[Purchase]

```

The exercise_4 package in the source contains a partial implementation that you may complete
as part of this exercise. It also has a test suite.
