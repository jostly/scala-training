# Exercise 1: Discount calculator

Since the discount calculations are done manually by the store clerks, it takes unnecessary
time and effort, and is prone to errors. Thus, we have been requested to build a simple
automated calculator.

Input:
 
* accumulated value of purchases on the card, not including current purchase
* current purchased amount
 
Output:

* amount for customer to pay for current purchase
* new accumulated purchase value

The threshold for receiving a discount is an accumulated purchase of â‚¬100 or more. 
The discount is 10%.

All amounts are assumed to be in euro, the application should not require or expect a currency
as part of the input.

Use stdin and stdout for input and output.

Example of reading input and writing output in Scala:

```scala
import scala.io.StdIn.readLine

val text = readLine()

println(s"You wrote: $text")
```

Example of output while running the program:

    Accumulated purchase value: 50
    Purchase amount: 100.50
    Amount to pay: 95.45
    New accumulated purchase value: 150.50
