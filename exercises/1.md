# Exercise 1: Discount calculator

## Scenario

Since the discount calculations are done manually by the store clerks, it takes
time and effort that could be better spent elsewhere.
The process is also prone to errors. Thus, we have been requested to build a simple
automated calculator.

Input:
 
* accumulated value of purchases on the card, not including current purchase
* current value of purchased items
 
Output:

* amount for customer to pay for current purchase
* new accumulated purchase value

The threshold for receiving a discount is an accumulated purchase of â‚¬100 or more. 
The discount is 10%.

All amounts are assumed to be in euro, the application should not require or expect a currency
as part of the input.

Use stdin and stdout for input and output.

## Examples

Example of reading input and writing output in Scala:

```scala
import scala.io.StdIn.readLine

val text = readLine()

println(s"You wrote: $text")
```

Example of output while running the program:

    Accumulated purchase value: 50
    Purchase amount: 100.50
    Amount to pay: 95.45
    New accumulated purchase value: 150.50

## Code skeleton

You will find code skeleton and tests in the `se.citerus.practicalscala.basic` package.

## Level up

If you finish the exercise with time left, try to think of a good way to test the entire
application, including input and output. See the `CalculatorAppTest` class.
