# Exercise 3: Keeping track of the customers

In order to further improve efficiency, and remove the risk of fraudulent manipulation of the cards,
the client wishes to move to a system that keeps track of each customer's accumulated purchases.

Each member of the loyalty club will now be issued a card with a unique identity code, which will be
scanned and sent to the system together with the purchase amount and the date of purchase.

The system needs to keep track of three things per customer:

* Member ID
* Date of first purchase
* Accumulated purchase value

The business rules are:

* If the member ID is not recorded, start a new record with date of purchase and purchase value 
* If the member ID is recorded, but the date of first purchase is more than a year before
    the date of the purchase, start a new record with date of purchase and purchase value
* Otherwise, add the purchase value to the accumulated purchase value
 
The output from the system should be:

* The amount for customer to pay for current purchase
* The accumulated purchase value
* The date of first purchase

For this exercise, in-memory storage of records will be used, with no persistance between instances of
the program. 


## Hints

Use case classes to represent member ID and member records, in order to easily use them in 
pattern matching. 

```scala
case class MemberRecord(firstPurchase: LocalDate, accumulatedValue: BigDecimal)
```

Pattern matching can have guard statements to qualify their matches, making the business rules 
easy to express as a pattern match:

```scala
val record: Option[MemberRecord] = ??? // look up record in storage, or None if not exist

record match {
  case None => ???
  case Some(MemberRecord(date, value)) if date.isBefore(oneYearAgo()) => ???
  case Some(MemberRecord(date, value)) => ???
}
```
