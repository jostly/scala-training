# Exercise 4: Working with event logs

## Scenario

For record-keeping purposes, another team has added an event log to the membership storage.
In order to integrate and remove redundancy, we are now going to explore the possibility of
reading state purely from the event log

In order to be able to verify that membership status is correct, the system must retain all
changes to a member account, in the form of a change log.

Implement the Account class, which wraps a list of events, and can answer the following
questions:
* What is the Member ID of the account?
* Is/was the account active at a certain date?
* What is/was the accumulated value of the account at a certain date?

Business rules:
* An account is said to be active at a certain date if there is a loyalty period started
less than a year before that date (` theDate.isBefore(periodStart.plusYears(1)) `)
* Value is accumulated only within a loyalty period, which lasts one year
* If a purchase is made on an inactive account, a new loyalty period starts at the date of the purchase

## Code skeleton

You will find code skeleton and tests in the `se.citerus.practicalscala.log` package.
The tests cover the simple case of up to one active loyalty period.

It is up to you to write tests to handle the case with several consecutive loyalty periods.

## Extra work

If you finish the exercise with time left, implement the purchase method in the Account
class, as well as write tests for it.
